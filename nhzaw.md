**What is the difference between a git "merge" and a GitHub "pull request"?**

A git "merge" is a local command used to combine two different branches within a single repository. A GitHub "pull request" is a web-based feature used to propose changes you've made in your forked repository so that the original project owner (like a professor) can review and merge them into their main project.
